Approximately six months<br>later I opened my second shop in Dearborn Heights, Michigan. In November of 2002, we sold the Gibraltar shop<br>in order to focus more on the shop in Dearborn Heights. Through the years, Liquid Chaos has had some amazing artists<br>in it's rooms, some of which have gone on to open their own successful shops, but all have on thing in common: They're the<br>best at what they do. I hold a very high standard for the artists I hire and we all strive to give the best possible experience.<br>Thank you for taking the time to check out our website, we look forward to serving you in all of your tattoo and body<br>piercing needs. Owner and operator, Jared "Bull" Ammons</p>
